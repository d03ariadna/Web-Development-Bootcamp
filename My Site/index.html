        <h3>Working Hard</h3>
        <p>Througout my life, I have learnt that giving my best is one of the most important things no matter what I am
          doing. I enjoy learning lots of new things, and as long as it is possible to me, I try to be the best in
          whatever I do. I become the most pasionate person once I find something really interesting to do or that's new
          for me. Learning will always be a pleasure:)</p>

        <h3>Making people Happy:)</h3>
        <p>I'm an introvert girl, of course I have friends and I love to create wonderful relationships with others. One
          of the things I enjoy the most is to tell the people I love how much I love them, that's why I am always
          giving them as many presents and details as I can. I truly think that everyone in this wolrd can teach you
          something really cool. That's why I'm always asking and being curious with people I find really interesting to
          know.</p>
